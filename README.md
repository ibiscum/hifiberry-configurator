# HiFiBerry Configurator

A comprehensive system configuration toolkit for HiFiBerry audio devices, providing both command-line tools and a REST API for managing system settings. This is the backend for HiFiBerryOS
that handles all system configuration. While it's possible to use it standalone, it's only goal is to provide the functionalities required for the HiFiBerryOS system configuration.
It's not designed to be a general standalone config tool.

## Features

### Configuration Management
- **Network Configuration**: Interface management, IPv6 control, and connectivity settings
- **Audio Configuration**: ALSA sound setup, sound card detection and configuration
- **System Configuration**: Raspberry Pi config.txt, kernel parameters, and HAT management
- **Storage & Sharing**: Samba client/mount management and volume control
- **Service Management**: systemd service control and monitoring

### Access Methods
- **Command-Line Tools**: Individual utilities for specific configuration tasks
- **REST API Server**: HTTP endpoints for programmatic configuration access
- **Configuration Database**: Centralized key-value storage with encryption support

### Platform Support
- Raspberry Pi with HiFiBerry HATs
- NetworkManager-based systems
- systemd-managed services

## Installation

This package is typically installed as part of HiFiBerry OS. For manual installation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs/` directory:

- **[Application Architecture](docs/architecture.md)** - How the `config-server` and command-line tools are bound together.
- **[Debian Package Installation](docs/debian-package.md)** - How the application is installed and integrated on a Debian-based system.
- **[API Documentation](docs/api-documentation.md)** - Complete REST API reference with examples
- **[Version Management](docs/version-management.md)** - Version management and release process
- **[cmdline Command Flow](docs/cmdline-command-flow.md)** - Execution flow for config-cmdline and cmdline.txt updates
- **[config_parser Flow](docs/config-parser-flow.md)** - How config loading, drop-in merging, caching, and reload work
- **[configtxt Command Flow](docs/configtxt-command-flow.md)** - Execution flow for config-configtxt and config.txt mutations
- **[dsptoolkit Flow](docs/dsptoolkit-command-flow.md)** - DSP detection request flow, helper APIs, and CLI output modes
- **[hattools Command Flow](docs/hattools-command-flow.md)** - HAT EEPROM read flow, output formats, and integration points

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
```

Async tests are handled by a local pytest hook in `tests/conftest.py`, so `@pytest.mark.asyncio` tests run without requiring `pytest-asyncio`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- NetworkManager (for network configuration)
- Root privileges (for system configuration changes)
